/**
 * Note about why we need to override these attributes
 *
 * there is this class on html and body:
 *   .nytc---modal-window---noScroll {
 *	    height: 100%;
 *	    overflow: hidden;
 *	    position: relative;
 *	};
 *
 * It causes issues:
 * 	1: unable to scroll
 * 		So we need to override `overflow` to make page scrollable.
 * 	2: images should be lazyloaded but do not load at all
 *     I just accidently find it out that removing this `height: 100%` will restore javascript's
 * functionality to lazyload images, so we are all set!
 *
 * We do not want to see the pop up for signup, so just hide it
